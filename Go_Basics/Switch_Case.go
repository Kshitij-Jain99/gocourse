	   	Switch statement in other languages (switch case break default)
	   	switch expression {
	   	case value1:
	   	     Code to be executed if expression equals value1
	   	     break;

	   	     Code to be executed if expression does not match any value
	   	     break;
	   	}

	   	In many languages, you must write break after each case.
	       In Go, break is implicit â†’ execution stops after the first match.
	       To continue to just next case, use fallthrough.
